#Texter App

This app relies on Firebase's stack of Realtime Database, Hosting, Functions, and Firestore, and interacts with Twilio via it's api.

### Setup Process

## Twilio

1. Buy a phone number
2. Set up Messaging Service
3. Copy required Env Variables

you'll need
- your Twilio Account SID
- your Twilio Auth Token (to authenticate requests)

You'll need to group your phone numbers together and get the 
- Messaging group SID

##  Set Environmental Variables

You'll need to set the Firebase Functions Twilio Env Variables like so:

```
firebase functions:config:set twilio.accountsid=sidxxxx twilio.authtoken=authtokenxxxxx

```

## Set your Messaging Group Request URLs and Callback URLs like so:

Click Messaging Service-> Intergration -> Send a webhook
Request URL: 
```
https://us-central1-<project-id-firebase>.cloudfunctions.net/twilioIncomingMessage```
```

Delivery Status Callback URL: 
```
Request URL: 
```
https://us-central1-<project-id-firebase>.cloudfunctions.net/callbackTwilioStatus```
```

Your HTTP Function URLs may vary because of your region / configuration. Check your firebase functions page for confirmation.
